## Exercise on eyes
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>

This exercise uses a mouseover event listener to move CSS-created eyeballs around the window, depending on where the mouse pointer is situated. 

Possible future improvement could include updated styling or incorporating the technique in entirely new project.
